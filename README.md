2. I selected Project 2

3. n/a

4. https://hub.docker.com/r/ak5kf/dockerhub

5. This project collected COVID-19 vaccination data from a .csv file found on Kaggle.com. It removed columns with statistically irrelevant information, gave information about the number of columns, entries, and brief summaries of each column, and it converted the .csv file to a .tsv file and writes it to the disk.

*note to grader: As I'm sure you can see, I uploaded/edited these documents past the project deadline. I was able to get my program finished by the deadline, but I was unable to get the docker image to work. I exhausted a very large number of class and internet resources as well as 12+ hours just to get this one part to work. For some reason, when I went back the next day (after the deadline) I was able to get the dockerfile image to work despite trying the same methods previously. I want to apologize for submitting late work, and my intention was not to deceive the grader with submitting my link to Collab on time, because I wanted to ensure the quiz would not close before I finished.
